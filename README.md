This is my game. The current working title is "game." I don't care if it sucks.

this game is a series of role playing battles between you and monsters.

You, the player, will go into several different areas. In these areas you'll either find a monster to fight or items to pick up to help fight the monsters.

1. The Dark Forest
2. Your House

Your House:
	This is where you'll get items to take to the Dark Forest to slay the dragon.
